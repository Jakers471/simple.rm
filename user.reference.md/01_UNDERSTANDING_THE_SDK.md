# Understanding the Claude Flow SDK - Core Concepts

## What You Need to Know (From Our Conversation)

### The Fundamental Confusion (And The Answer)

**Your Key Question:** "How do I use the SDK? Do I just talk to Claude and it handles everything?"

**The Answer:** The SDK is NOT a complete development workflow - it's an **execution engine** that needs **specifications first**.

---

## The Two-Phase Reality

### ❌ What the SDK CANNOT Do:
- Interview you about requirements
- Ask clarifying questions about features
- Cross-reference API documentation
- Validate if your ideas are technically feasible
- Create detailed specifications from vague ideas
- **Perform discovery work**

### ✅ What the SDK CAN Do:
- Execute tasks in parallel (2.8-4.4x faster)
- Spawn specialized agents (coder, tester, reviewer, etc.)
- Coordinate via memory and hooks
- Build code from clear specifications
- Self-heal through agent coordination
- **Perform execution work**

## Your Custom Planning Agents (The Missing Piece)

**Location:** `C:\Users\jakers\Desktop\simple risk manager\archive\agents\`

### planner_agent.md (Requirements Interviewer)
**Purpose:** Interviews you to understand what to build

**What it does:**
- Asks structured questions about your project
- Cross-references TopstepX API documentation during interview
- Validates technical feasibility ("that API endpoint doesn't exist")
- Challenges assumptions ("the API already does that, don't rebuild it")
- Explains technical concepts in beginner-friendly terms
- Creates comprehensive planning documentation AFTER understanding requirements

**Why you built it:**
The SDK has NO built-in discovery/interview process. You correctly identified this gap and filled it.

### deep_spec.md (Architecture Synthesizer)
**Purpose:** Takes planning notes and creates detailed architecture specs

**What it does:**
- Reads PLANNING_SESSION_NOTES.md
- Synthesizes into 11 architecture documents
- Creates AI_BUILDER_PROMPT.md for SDK agents
- Uses placeholders where details are missing
- Asks targeted questions for gaps

**Output:**
Complete specification documents that SDK agents can use to build from.

## How Claude Works in This System

**Claude (in chat with you) can be ANY of these:**

### 1. Your Planner Agent (Discovery Phase)
```
You: "Interview me using my planner_agent.md"
Claude: *Reads that file*
Claude: *Becomes that agent*
Claude: "Let's understand your project. What are you building?"
[Structured interview process]
Claude: *Creates comprehensive specs*
```

### 2. SDK Coordinator (Execution Phase)
```
You: "Use SDK to build from these specs"
Claude: *Spawns SDK agents via Task tool*
Agents: *Build in parallel, coordinate via memory*
Claude: *Orchestrates and monitors*
```

### 3. Both (Sequential)
```
You: "Interview me first, then build with SDK"
Claude: *Phase 1: Planner mode*
Claude: *Phase 2: SDK coordinator mode*
```

**Key Point:** You only talk to Claude. Claude orchestrates everything else.

## The .md Agent Files Explained

**Your Custom Agents** (`/archive/agents/`):
- Instructions for Claude to role-play
- Interactive with you (Q&A, discussion)
- Discovery-focused

**SDK Built-In Agents** (`/.claude/agents/`):
- Instructions for spawned agents
- Non-interactive (execute tasks)
- Execution-focused

**How they work:**
- Your agents: Claude reads them as instructions in THIS chat
- SDK agents: Claude spawns them via Task tool to run independently

---

## MCP Tools vs Claude Code's Task Tool

### MCP Tools (Coordination Setup)
```javascript
// OPTIONAL: Set up coordination topology
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init({ topology: "mesh", maxAgents: 6 })
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({ type: "researcher" })
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn({ type: "coder" })
```
**What they do:** Set up coordination infrastructure, not actual execution

### Claude Code's Task Tool (ACTUAL EXECUTION)
```javascript
// REQUIRED: Spawn agents that do the work
Task("Research agent", "Analyze API docs and create integration plan", "researcher")
Task("Backend coder", "Build SignalR listener module", "coder")
Task("Tester", "Write tests for rule enforcement", "tester")
```
**What they do:** Spawn REAL agents that execute, code, test, review

**Critical Understanding:**
- MCP = optional coordination layer
- Task tool = actual work execution
- You need Task tool to build code
- MCP just helps agents coordinate better

---

## Can SDK Read API Docs?

**Short Answer:** Yes, but it's not automatic.

**What happens:**
```javascript
// You can do this:
Task("Researcher", `
  Read TopstepX API docs at /archive/projectx_gateway_api/
  Understand the order placement flow and event types.
  Create integration specification.
`, "researcher")
```

**BUT:**
- SDK doesn't automatically cross-reference
- Researcher agent might misunderstand your intent
- No validation that features match API capabilities
- More iterations needed

**Your Approach (Better):**
- Planner agent interviews you + reads API docs
- Validates features against API during discovery
- Creates pre-mapped specifications
- SDK builds from validated specs
- Fewer errors, less iteration

---

## Your Archive Docs - Current Status

**Location:** `C:\Users\jakers\Desktop\simple risk manager\archive\OLD_PROJECT_DOCS\`

**What you have:**
- ✅ Project overview (SUM-001)
- ✅ System architecture v2 (ARCH-V2)
- ✅ 12 detailed risk rules (RULE-001 to RULE-012)
- ✅ 4 core modules (MOD-001 to MOD-004)
- ✅ TopstepX API integration specs
- ✅ Complete directory structure
- ✅ Python implementation examples

**Quality Assessment:** 95% complete for SDK usage

**What SDK agents can do with these:**
- Read them directly
- Build the entire system
- Ask questions for small gaps

**Small Gaps (easily filled):**
- Exact CLI command syntax (structure exists)
- Windows Service deployment procedure (concept exists)
- Error recovery scenarios (happy path defined)

## The Critical Insight You Discovered

> "The whole reason I built the planner and integration to API agents was to make sure everything was specifically laid out exactly how I wanted it to be."

**You were 100% correct!**

**Without your planning agents:**
- SDK agents would make assumptions about API integration
- Might use wrong endpoints
- Might miss important SignalR events
- Communication with broker could be incorrect

**With your planning agents:**
- Every feature pre-validated against TopstepX API
- You KNOW it works before coding starts
- SDK agents have crystal-clear instructions
- Broker communication guaranteed correct

## Summary of Our Conversation

### Your Questions:
1. "How do I use the SDK?" → Use it for EXECUTION after you have specs
2. "Who plans the features?" → YOU (via custom agents) or informal chat with Claude
3. "Can SDK read API docs?" → Yes, but your pre-mapped approach is better
4. "Do I need to build out API mappings?" → You already did! Your docs have them
5. "What if docs don't cover SDK tasks?" → Your docs are comprehensive enough

### Key Takeaways:
- SDK = execution engine (needs specifications)
- Your planner agents = discovery engine (creates specifications)
- Claude = can be both (switches between roles)
- Your docs = ready for SDK (95% complete)
- No need for more planning unless you want validation

### Next Steps (Your Choice):
- **Option A:** Start building with SDK now
- **Option B:** Quick gap analysis (5 min)
- **Option C:** Full validation interview (15 min)

## Common Confusions (Addressed)

**"Do I talk to the SDK or to Claude?"**
→ You talk to Claude. Claude orchestrates SDK.

**"Are the .md files agents themselves?"**
→ No, they're instruction sets for Claude or spawned agents.

**"Can I split Claude into multiple parallel agents?"**
→ Yes, via Task tool. Each spawned agent runs independently.

**"How does Claude know how to structure docs for SDK?"**
→ Your docs already have good structure. SDK is flexible.

**"Is there a pre-built agent for planning?"**
→ SDK has task decomposition agents, not discovery agents. That's why you built your own.

**"What's the difference between MCP and Task tool?"**
→ MCP = coordination setup (optional), Task = actual execution (required).
