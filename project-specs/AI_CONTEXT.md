## üîë Key Architectural Concepts

### The System Has 3 Main Parts:

1. **Backend Daemon** (`src/core/`, `src/api/`, `src/enforcement/`, `src/rules/`, `src/state/`)
   - Runs as Windows Service
   - Listens to TopstepX SignalR events
   - Checks rules on every event
   - Enforces violations via REST API
   - Manages state in SQLite

2. **Internal API** (TO BE DESIGNED - see SPECS/05-INTERNAL-API/)
   - Daemon exposes state to CLI tools
   - CLIs query current status
   - CLIs receive real-time updates
   - **DECISION NEEDED:** Communication method

3. **CLI Frontends** (`src/cli/admin/`, `src/cli/trader/`)
   - Admin CLI: password-protected, can modify config
   - Trader CLI: view-only, shows status & timers
   - Both connect to daemon via internal API

### Data Flow:
```
TopstepX (Broker)
    ‚Üì SignalR events
Backend Daemon (risk engine)
    ‚Üì state changes
Internal API
    ‚Üì queries/updates
CLI Frontends (admin/trader)
```

---

## üí° Design Principles (Why We Made These Choices)

1. **Event-Driven Architecture:** No polling, react to TopstepX events
2. **Modular Rules:** Each rule = one file, easy to add/remove
3. **Centralized Enforcement:** All rules use MOD-001 (no duplication)
4. **State Persistence:** SQLite ensures recovery from crashes
5. **No Blocking:** Can't prevent orders, but close within milliseconds
6. **File Size Limit:** No file over 200 lines (maintainability)

---

## üìã Open Questions (Need User Input)

### Critical Decisions Needed:
1. **Internal API Communication Method**
   - HTTP REST API on localhost?
   - Named Pipes (Windows IPC)?
   - Direct SQLite reads?
   - WebSocket for real-time?

2. **CLI Update Mechanism**
   - Poll every second?
   - Server-sent events?
   - WebSocket stream?
   - Database watch?

3. **Admin CLI Authentication**
   - Password hash in file?
   - Windows authentication?
   - API key?

### Design Clarifications Needed:
- Exact SQLite schema (tables, columns, indexes)
- Exact state object structures (Python dataclasses)
- CLI screen layouts (what info on each screen?)
- Configuration validation rules (what makes config invalid?)

## üéì Context for AI Agents

**This is not a typical software project.** This is an AI-assisted design and build process where:
- The user (project owner) is collaborating with AI agents to design AND build
- Specifications are primarily for AI consumption, not human developers
- Documentation needs to be precise enough for AI to generate working code
- Open questions in specs are intentional - waiting for user decisions

**When you see a `_TODO.md` file:** That section needs design work. Ask the user questions to help make decisions, then document the answers.

**When you see detailed specs:** Those are ready for implementation. You can generate code from them.

---

## üöÄ How to Help

### If user asks you to continue design work:
1. Identify which SPECS folder has `_TODO.md`
2. Read related existing specs for context
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Document decisions in new spec files
5. Update this AI_CONTEXT.md

### If user asks you to implement something:
1. Check if specs are complete (no `_TODO.md` in that area)
2. If incomplete: flag missing specs, help complete them first
3. If complete: read all related specs, then generate code
4. Follow architecture exactly as specified

### If user asks for your opinion:
1. Reference the design principles above
2. Suggest options that align with existing architecture
3. Explain tradeoffs clearly
4. Let user make final decision

## üìû Common Questions Answered

**Q: Where do I start reading?**
A: `SPECS/00-CORE-CONCEPT/system_architecture_v2.md` - the master architecture doc

**Q: Can I change the architecture?**
A: Only with user approval. Suggest changes but don't implement without confirmation.

**Q: What if I find incomplete specs?**
A: Note what's missing, ask user for guidance, help document the decisions.

**Q: Should I generate code now?**
A: Only if the relevant specs are complete. Check for `_TODO.md` files first.

**Q: How detailed should specs be?**
A: Detailed enough that AI can generate working code without ambiguity.
