# Concurrency Handling Specification

**doc_id:** ORDER-003
**version:** 1.0
**status:** DRAFT
**addresses:** GAP-API-SCENARIO-004 (MEDIUM) from ERRORS_AND_WARNINGS_CONSOLIDATED.md
**created:** 2025-10-22
**category:** Order Management / Concurrency Control

---

## Overview

This specification defines the concurrency handling system for order management operations when multiple sessions, processes, or threads attempt to interact with the same account simultaneously. The system must prevent race conditions, ensure data consistency, handle conflicts gracefully, and maintain order integrity during concurrent operations.

**Problem Statement:**
- Can multiple sessions use the same authentication token?
- What happens with concurrent order placement?
- How are order modification conflicts handled?
- What if multiple processes try to close same position?
- How to ensure consistent state across concurrent operations?

**Solution:**
Lock-based concurrency control with conflict detection, event ordering by timestamp, optimistic locking for reads, and clear conflict resolution strategies.

## Concurrency Control Architecture

### Lock Hierarchy

```
Lock Hierarchy (Acquisition Order to Prevent Deadlock):
  1. Account Lock              (Coarsest grain)
  2. Position Lock             (Medium grain)
  3. Order Lock                (Finest grain)

Lock Types:
  - Shared Lock (S):      Multiple readers, no writers
  - Exclusive Lock (X):   Single writer, no readers
  - Intent Lock (IX):     Intent to acquire exclusive locks on children
```

### Lock Acquisition Rules

```yaml
Lock Acquisition Rules:

  # Rule 1: Always acquire locks in hierarchy order
  - Order: Account → Position → Order
  - Rationale: Prevents circular dependencies and deadlocks

  # Rule 2: Read operations use shared locks
  - Operation: Query order status, list positions
  - Lock Type: Shared (S)
  - Allows: Concurrent reads

  # Rule 3: Write operations use exclusive locks
  - Operation: Place order, modify order, close position
  - Lock Type: Exclusive (X)
  - Blocks: All other operations on same resource

  # Rule 4: Lock timeout for deadlock prevention
  - Timeout: 1000ms (1 second)
  - Action: Release all locks, retry with exponential backoff

  # Rule 5: Lock hold time limit
  - MaxHoldTime: 100ms
  - Action: Log warning, investigate slow operations
```

---

## Concurrent Order Placement

### Problem Scenario

```yaml
Scenario:
  - Client A sends BUY order for AAPL (100 shares)
  - Client B sends BUY order for AAPL (50 shares)
  - Both orders arrive within 10ms
  - Same account, same symbol

Risk:
  - Race condition in balance check
  - Double-spend of available funds
  - Inconsistent position state
```

### Solution: Account-Level Order Queue

```python
class AccountOrderQueue:
    """
    Serialize order placement operations per account.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.queues: Dict[str, Queue] = {}
        self.locks: Dict[str, Lock] = {}
        self.workers: Dict[str, Thread] = {}

    async def submit_order(self, account_id: str, order_request: OrderRequest):
        """
        Submit order to account-specific queue.
        """
        # 1. Get or create queue for account
        if account_id not in self.queues:
            self.queues[account_id] = Queue()
            self.locks[account_id] = Lock()
            self.workers[account_id] = Thread(
                target=self.process_order_queue,
                args=(account_id,)
            )
            self.workers[account_id].start()

        # 2. Enqueue order request
        self.queues[account_id].put(order_request)

        # 3. Return immediately (async processing)
        return OrderSubmissionReceipt(
            requestId=order_request.requestId,
            status="queued",
            queuePosition=self.queues[account_id].qsize()
        )

    def process_order_queue(self, account_id: str):
        """
        Worker thread to process orders sequentially per account.
        """
        queue = self.queues[account_id]
        lock = self.locks[account_id]

        while True:
            order_request = queue.get()

            try:
                # Acquire exclusive account lock
                with lock:
                    # Process order (balance check, risk rules, API call)
                    result = self.execute_order(account_id, order_request)

                    # Update account state
                    self.update_account_state(account_id, result)

                    # Emit result event
                    emit_order_result(order_request.requestId, result)

            except Exception as e:
                log_error(f"Order processing error: {e}")
                emit_order_error(order_request.requestId, e)

            finally:
                queue.task_done()
```

### Concurrent Order Flow

```
Client A Order                    Client B Order
     |                                 |
     |---> AccountOrderQueue <---------|
              |
              v
     [Account Lock Acquired]
              |
              +---> Process Order A
              |       - Check balance
              |       - Apply risk rules
              |       - Place order via API
              |       - Update state
              |
     [Account Lock Released]
              |
              v
     [Account Lock Acquired]
              |
              +---> Process Order B
              |       - Check balance (updated from Order A)
              |       - Apply risk rules
              |       - Place order via API
              |       - Update state
              |
     [Account Lock Released]
```

**Benefits:**
- Orders processed sequentially per account
- No race conditions in balance checks
- Consistent state updates
- Fair ordering (FIFO queue)
- Non-blocking for different accounts

## Order Modification Conflicts

### Problem Scenario

```yaml
Scenario:
  - User modifies order via Web UI (update limit price)
  - Risk rule modifies same order simultaneously (add stop loss)
  - Both modifications sent to API at same time

Risk:
  - Lost update (one modification overwrites the other)
  - Inconsistent order state
  - User intent lost
```

### Solution: Optimistic Locking with Version Numbers

```python
class Order:
    """
    Order with version number for optimistic locking.
    """
    orderId: str
    accountId: str
    symbol: str
    quantity: float
    limitPrice: Optional[float]
    stopPrice: Optional[float]
    version: int  # Incremented on each modification
    lastModifiedTime: int
    lastModifiedBy: str  # "user" | "risk_rule" | "system"

def modify_order(order_id: str, modifications: dict, expected_version: int):
    """
    Modify order with optimistic locking.
    """
    # 1. Acquire exclusive order lock
    with order_lock(order_id):
        # 2. Retrieve current order
        order = get_order(order_id)

        # 3. Version check (optimistic locking)
        if order.version != expected_version:
            # Conflict detected
            raise ConcurrentModificationError(
                message=f"Order modified by another process",
                currentOrder=order,
                attemptedModifications=modifications,
                expectedVersion=expected_version,
                currentVersion=order.version
            )

        # 4. Apply modifications
        for field, value in modifications.items():
            setattr(order, field, value)

        # 5. Increment version
        order.version += 1
        order.lastModifiedTime = get_current_time()

        # 6. Persist changes
        update_order(order)

        # 7. Emit modification event
        emit_order_modified(order)

        return order
```

### Conflict Resolution Strategy

```python
def handle_modification_conflict(error: ConcurrentModificationError):
    """
    Handle order modification conflict.
    """
    # 1. Log conflict
    log_warning(f"Order modification conflict: {error.orderId}")

    # 2. Determine resolution strategy
    if error.lastModifiedBy == "risk_rule":
        # Risk rules take precedence over user modifications
        strategy = "reject_user_modification"
    elif error.attemptedModifications.keys().intersection(
        error.currentOrder.get_modified_fields()
    ):
        # Fields conflict - require manual resolution
        strategy = "manual_resolution"
    else:
        # No field conflict - can merge modifications
        strategy = "merge_modifications"

    # 3. Execute strategy
    if strategy == "reject_user_modification":
        notify_user("Order modified by risk rule, your change rejected")
        return error.currentOrder

    elif strategy == "merge_modifications":
        # Merge non-conflicting fields
        merged = merge_modifications(
            error.currentOrder,
            error.attemptedModifications
        )
        # Retry with new version
        return modify_order(
            error.orderId,
            merged,
            expected_version=error.currentVersion
        )

    elif strategy == "manual_resolution":
        # Escalate to user
        notify_user("Order conflict requires manual resolution")
        present_conflict_resolution_ui(error)
        return None
```

### Modification Conflict Matrix

```yaml
Conflict Resolution Priority:

  # Risk Rule vs User
  RiskRule > User:
    - Risk rule modifications ALWAYS take precedence
    - User notified of override
    - Example: Risk rule adds stop loss, user tries to remove it → Risk rule wins

  # System vs User
  System > User:
    - System-initiated modifications (e.g., fill updates) take precedence
    - User modification rejected if conflicts with system state
    - Example: System marks order filled, user tries to cancel → System wins

  # User vs User (Different Sessions)
  User1 vs User2:
    - First modification wins (optimistic locking)
    - Second modification rejected with conflict error
    - User2 must retry with current state
    - Example: User modifies limit price in app and web simultaneously → First wins

  # Non-Conflicting Fields
  Merge Strategy:
    - If modified fields don't overlap → Merge both modifications
    - Example: User1 updates limit price, User2 updates stop loss → Both applied
```

## Position Close Concurrency

### Problem Scenario

```yaml
Scenario:
  - User clicks "Close Position" button twice rapidly
  - Risk rule triggers position close simultaneously
  - Multiple close orders submitted for same position

Risk:
  - Over-trading (closing more than position size)
  - Double order fees
  - Negative position (short when intending flat)
```

### Solution: Position Close Lock

```python
class PositionCloseCoordinator:
    """
    Coordinate concurrent position close operations.

### Concurrent Close Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Double-Click Prevention**
```yaml
Timeline:
  T+0ms:   User clicks "Close Position"
  T+10ms:  First close operation acquires lock
  T+50ms:  User clicks again (double-click)
  T+55ms:  Second close attempt finds active close, returns immediately

Outcome:
  - First close: Order placed
  - Second close: Rejected with "close in progress" message
  - User notified: "Position already being closed"
  - Zero duplicate orders
```

**Scenario 2: User vs Risk Rule**
```yaml
Timeline:
  T+0ms:   User initiates manual close
  T+5ms:   Risk rule triggers automatic close
  T+10ms:  User's close acquires lock first
  T+15ms:  Risk rule's close finds active close, waits

Outcome:
  - User's close: Proceeds
  - Risk rule's close: Detects position already closing, cancels own close
  - Single close order placed
  - Position closed once
```

**Scenario 3: Partial Close Concurrency**
```yaml
Timeline:
  T+0ms:   User A closes 50% of position (100 shares, close 50)
  T+10ms:  User B closes 50% of position (close 50)
  T+20ms:  User A's close acquires lock, places order for 50
  T+30ms:  User B's close waits for lock
  T+500ms: User A's close completes, position now 50 shares
  T+510ms: User B's close acquires lock, places order for 50
  T+1000ms: User B's close completes, position now 0 shares

Outcome:
  - Both closes succeed sequentially
  - Position fully closed (50 + 50 = 100)
  - No over-trading
```

## Multi-Session Token Usage

### Token Sharing Model

```yaml
TokenSharingModel:

  # API Provider Support
  multipleSessionsAllowed: true
  sessionsPerToken: unlimited
  sessionIsolation: false  # Sessions share state

  # Application Strategy

### Session Isolation Rules

```yaml
SessionIsolation:

  # Shared State (Synchronized Across Sessions)
  sharedState:
    - account_balance
    - open_positions
    - active_orders
    - realized_pnl
    - risk_rule_violations

  # Session-Specific State (NOT Synchronized)
  sessionState:
    - ui_preferences
    - chart_settings
    - selected_symbol
    - notification_preferences
    - local_draft_orders (not submitted)

  # Cross-Session Events (Broadcast to All)
  broadcastEvents:
    - order_placed
    - order_filled
    - order_cancelled
    - position_opened
    - position_closed
    - risk_rule_triggered
    - balance_updated
```

## Event Ordering by Timestamp

### Problem: Out-of-Order Events

```yaml
Problem:
  - SignalR events arrive out of chronological order
  - Network latency causes reordering
  - Multiple event sources (API callbacks, SignalR, webhooks)

Example:
  T+0ms:   Order placed (orderId: ORD-123)
  T+100ms: Order filled (fillVolume: 100)
  T+50ms:  Order acknowledged (status: SUBMITTED)  ← Arrives late

Received Order:
  1. Order placed (T+0ms)
  2. Order filled (T+100ms)  ← Wrong! Shows filled before acknowledged
  3. Order acknowledged (T+50ms)  ← Arrives late
```

### Solution: Server Timestamp Ordering

```python
class EventOrderingQueue:
    """
    Order events by server timestamp, not arrival time.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.event_buffer: List[Event] = []
        self.buffer_window_ms = 500  # Wait up to 500ms for late events
        self.last_processed_timestamp = 0
        self.processing_timer = None

    def receive_event(self, event: Event):
        """
        Receive event and add to buffer for ordering.
        """
        # 1. Use server timestamp, not client timestamp
        event.orderingTimestamp = event.serverTimestamp

        # 2. Add to buffer
        self.event_buffer.append(event)

        # 3. Sort buffer by timestamp
        self.event_buffer.sort(key=lambda e: e.orderingTimestamp)

        # 4. Schedule processing (after buffer window)
        if self.processing_timer:
            self.processing_timer.cancel()

        self.processing_timer = Timer(
            self.buffer_window_ms / 1000,
            self.process_buffered_events
        )
        self.processing_timer.start()

    def process_buffered_events(self):
        """
        Process events in chronological order after buffer window.
        """
        current_time = get_current_time()

        # Process events older than buffer window
        cutoff_time = current_time - self.buffer_window_ms

        events_to_process = [
            e for e in self.event_buffer
            if e.orderingTimestamp <= cutoff_time
        ]

        for event in events_to_process:
            # Skip if already processed (duplicate)
            if event.orderingTimestamp <= self.last_processed_timestamp:
                log_warning(f"Skipping old event: {event.eventId}")
                continue

            # Process event
            self.handle_event(event)

            # Update last processed timestamp
            self.last_processed_timestamp = event.orderingTimestamp

            # Remove from buffer
            self.event_buffer.remove(event)

        # Reschedule if events remain
        if self.event_buffer:
            self.processing_timer = Timer(
                self.buffer_window_ms / 1000,
                self.process_buffered_events
            )
            self.processing_timer.start()
```

### Timestamp Conflict Resolution

```yaml
TimestampConflicts:

  # Case 1: Identical Timestamps
  events:
    - event_1: {timestamp: 1729636823500, type: "order_placed"}
    - event_2: {timestamp: 1729636823500, type: "order_acknowledged"}

  resolution:
    - Use event sequence number as tiebreaker
    - Use event type hierarchy: placed < acknowledged < filled
    - Maintain insertion order if no hierarchy defined

  # Case 2: Clock Skew
  events:
    - event_1: {timestamp: 1729636823600, source: "server_A"}
    - event_2: {timestamp: 1729636823500, source: "server_B"}  # Earlier but arrived later

  resolution:
    - Use vector clocks or logical clocks
    - Detect clock skew and adjust
    - Log clock skew incidents for monitoring
```

### Deadlock Prevention Strategy

```yaml
DeadlockPrevention:

  # Strategy 1: Lock Ordering
  rule: "Always acquire locks in hierarchy order"
  hierarchy: [Account, Position, Order]
  enforcement: Runtime assertion

  # Strategy 2: Lock Timeout
  rule: "Release locks after timeout"
  timeout: 1000ms
  action: Retry with exponential backoff

  # Strategy 3: Deadlock Detection
  rule: "Detect cycles in wait-for graph"
  detectionInterval: 1000ms
  resolution: Abort youngest transaction

  # Strategy 4: Lock-Free Reads
  rule: "Use MVCC for read operations"
  implementation: Versioned state snapshots
  benefit: Reads never block writes
```
