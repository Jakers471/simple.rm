# Development Session: 2025-10-19

## Session Overview
**Duration**: 11:35 - In Progress
**Focus**: Agent workflow setup and project structure initialization

## What We Did

### 1. Claude-Flow SDK Integration
- âœ… Cloned claude-flow SDK to `references/claude-flow/` for reference
- âœ… Added `references/` to `.gitignore` to keep it separate from project
- âœ… Studied claude-flow agent system and workflow patterns
- âœ… Read documentation on 65+ specialized agents
- âœ… Understood SPARC methodology and coordination patterns

### 2. Project Structure Setup
- âœ… Created comprehensive directory structure:
  - `docs/architecture/` - Architecture documentation
  - `docs/api/` - API specifications
  - `docs/decisions/` - Architecture Decision Records
  - `docs/plans/` - Development plans
  - `docs/sessions/` - Session logs
  - `docs/workflows/` - Agent workflow guides
  - `src/`, `tests/`, `config/`, `scripts/` - Code directories

### 3. Documentation Created
- âœ… **AGENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide for using agents in this project
- âœ… **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Complete project overview and current state
- âœ… **AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md** - 3-phase development plan with agent assignments

## Key Learnings from Claude-Flow

### Agent Types Available (65+)
**Core Development**: coder, planner, researcher, reviewer, tester
**Specialized**: backend-dev, system-architect, api-docs, cicd-engineer
**GitHub Integration**: pr-manager, code-review-swarm, issue-tracker
**Testing**: tdd-london-swarm, production-validator
**Analysis**: perf-analyzer, code-analyzer

### Workflow Patterns
1. **Concurrent Execution**: Always batch agents in single messages
2. **Documentation-Based Memory**: Use structured docs instead of ReasoningBank
3. **Session Continuity**: Maintain session logs for context
4. **SPARC Methodology**: Specification â†’ Pseudocode â†’ Architecture â†’ Refinement â†’ Completion

### Critical Rules
- âœ… Use Claude Code's Task tool for agent spawning (not just MCP)
- âœ… Batch ALL operations in single messages for parallel execution
- âœ… MCP tools coordinate, Claude Code Task tool executes
- âœ… Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- âœ… Document decisions immediately in ADRs

## Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **AD-001**: Use agent-based development workflow inspired by claude-flow
- **AD-002**: Document-based memory system (not ReasoningBank)
- **AD-003**: Session logs for continuity between development sessions
- **AD-004**: 3-phase development plan (Foundation â†’ Advanced â†’ Production)

### Organization Decisions
- Keep claude-flow SDK in `references/` folder (read-only, not tracked in git)
- Use `docs/workflows/` for agent coordination guides
- Use `docs/sessions/` for daily session logs
- Use `docs/plans/` for sprint and feature planning

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `references/claude-flow/` - Cloned SDK (7695 files)
- `.gitignore` - Added references/ exclusion
- `docs/workflows/AGENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Agent usage guide
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Project overview
- `docs/plans/AGENT_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - 3-phase plan
- `docs/sessions/2025-10-19.md` - This session log

- `tests/` - Test suite (needs expansion)

**Recent git commits**:
```
abda273 CRITICAL FIX: Wire up EventNormalizer to daemon EventBus
0bae835 Fix daemon startup: EventBus API corrections
cbac310 Fix SessionBlockOutsideRule initialization
```

## Notes

### Agent Workflow Pattern
Always spawn agents in **single messages** for parallel execution:

```javascript
// âœ… CORRECT
[Single Message]:
  Task("Backend Developer", "Implement IBKR adapter", "backend-dev")
  Task("Test Engineer", "Create test suite for IBKR", "tester")
  Task("API Docs", "Document IBKR integration", "api-docs")
  TodoWrite { todos: [all todos] }
  Write "src/adapters/ibkr_adapter.py"
  Write "tests/test_ibkr_adapter.py"
```

### Development Principles
1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
2. 90%+ code coverage requirement
3. Event-driven architecture
4. Clean code and SOLID principles
5. Document as you go
6. Review before merging

### Key Findings from SDK

**SDK Provides**:
- **65+ Prebuilt Agents** (no custom framework needed!)
- **SPARC Planning Agents**: `architect`, `planner`, `researcher`, `analyst`, `specification`
- **Commands**: `npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run [agent] "task"`
- **Persistent Memory**: Store decisions across sessions
- **Swarm Coordination**: Multi-agent collaboration
- **Performance**: 84.8% SWE-Bench score, 2.8-4.4x speed

**Perfect for Your Planning Phase**:
- Use SDK agents to READ and EXTEND your existing docs
- `architect` agent can improve ARCH-V2
- `planner` agent can create implementation roadmaps
- `researcher` agent can research technology options
- `analyst` agent can find gaps in specs
- Memory system persists all planning decisions

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Initialize SDK** in your project:
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow@alpha init --force
   ```

2. **Start Planning with SDK Agents**:
   ```bash
   # Example: Analyze architecture
   npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run analyst \
     "Analyze docs/ for gaps in specifications"
   ```

3. **Choose Focus Area**:
   - Architecture refinement
   - Implementation planning
   - Technology research
   - Or all three (hive-mind mode)

## ðŸŽ“ Final Update: SDK Fully Explained (1:00 PM)

### User Questions Answered

User was confused about:
- Where do SDK agent docs live?
- Where does memory live?
- How do agents know what to do?
- Do I edit agents or use them?
- What does SDK actually allow?
- What to focus on?

### Deep Dive Completed

**Explored SDK internals**:
- Found 78 agent `.md` files in `references/claude-flow/.claude/agents/`
- Memory system: SQLite database in `.swarm/memory.db`
- Agents work exactly like user's custom agents (markdown instructions)
- Commands load agent instructions and run them through Claude

### Additional Documentation Created

1. **SDK_HOW_IT_ACTUALLY_WORKS.md**
   - Answers ALL user questions
   - Step-by-step flow explanations
   - Clear comparisons to custom agents
   - What to focus on vs what to ignore

2. **SDK_VISUAL_EXPLANATION.md**
   - Visual diagrams of full system
   - Command flow charts
   - Single vs multi-agent workflows
   - Planning workflow visuals

3. **SDK_README.md** (root level)
   - Quick overview
   - Points to all documentation
   - Super quick start (3 commands)
   - TL;DR summary

### Key Insights

**How SDK Actually Works**:
1. You run command: `npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run planner "task"`
2. SDK reads agent file: `references/claude-flow/.claude/agents/core/planner.md`
3. SDK sends instructions to Claude (me!)
4. I execute as that agent with those instructions
5. Results returned, memory stored

**SDK vs Custom Agents**:
- Custom: You manually orchestrate everything
- SDK: Infrastructure handles orchestration, memory, coordination automatically

**What User Should Do**:
- Focus on: Learning commands
- Don't focus on: SDK internals, editing agents
- Just use it: Run commands, agents do the work
