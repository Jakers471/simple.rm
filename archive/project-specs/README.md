# Archived PROJECT_DOCS

**Archived:** 2025-01-21
**Reason:** Original documentation structure preserved for reference

## What's Here

This is the original `PROJECT_DOCS/` directory before it was reorganized into the new `SPECS/` structure.

**Original Structure:**
```
PROJECT_DOCS/
├── architecture/
├── api/
├── rules/
├── modules/
├── projectx_gateway_api/
└── ... other folders
```

---

## New Location

All content from here has been **copied** (not moved) to:
```
project-specs/SPECS/
├── 00-CORE-CONCEPT/      (from architecture/)
├── 01-EXTERNAL-API/      (from api/ and projectx_gateway_api/)
├── 03-RISK-RULES/        (from rules/)
├── 04-CORE-MODULES/      (from modules/)
└── ...
```

---

## Why Archived

- Original files preserved for safety
- New organized structure in `SPECS/` for AI agents
- This archive ensures nothing is lost
- Can reference original if needed

**Use the new SPECS/ structure going forward. This is just a backup.**
