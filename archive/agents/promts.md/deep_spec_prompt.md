Task:
Synthesize a precise, minimal, build-ready specification for a solo developer. Stay theory-only; use developer terms; invent no domain details. Use <PLACEHOLDER> tokens where specifics are missing. Extract themes, constraints, decisions, and gaps; ask targeted clarification questions. Keep scope pragmatic: few components, explicit interfaces, simple modes.

Produce (separate markdown files):
- operating_plan.md (pipeline & four edges: Input/Decision/Action/Effect)
- readiness_checklist.md (today’s preflight)
- observability_handoff.md (heartbeat edges, tracing triggers, timing cues)
- testing_strategy_map.md (unit/integration/e2e/smoke/contract checks; what each covers)
- requirements.md (functional & non-functional; assumptions; out-of-scope)
- scenarios.md (primary flows, edge cases, acceptance criteria)
- architecture.md (minimal decomposition, data flow, runtime modes: mock/sim/real)
- interfaces.yaml (contracts: ops, I/O shapes, pre/postconditions, error shapes)
- config.md (env/modes matrix, flags, secrets policy—placeholders only)
- risks_and_decisions.md (ranked risks, rationale)
- open_questions.md (prioritized questions to replace assumptions)
- ai_builder_prompt.md (clear “AI language” build instructions; acceptance criteria; mode switch; PR self-check)
- scaffold_plan.md (iteration order, cutlines, review points)

Constraints:
- Minimal-first; 2–5 components unless justified.
- No domain inventions; use placeholders and record questions.
- Optimize for clarity, testability, and runtime observability handoff to FlowSentinel.
